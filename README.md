# README of the Incremental Natural Interactions on Turtlebot (INIT) project #

This project is centered around the creation and research of incremental natural interactions on a Turtlebot3 Burger robot

## Dependencies

This project needs `ROSCORE` to function properly.

A `ROSCORE` compatible Linux environment is strongly recommended.

In case you do not have access to a Turtlebot3 Burger robot, a `ROSCORE` compatible simulator with a working Turtlebot model will also be needed.
(for example `Gazebo`)
