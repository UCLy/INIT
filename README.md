# README of the Incremental Natural Interactions on Turtlebot (INIT) project #

The INIT project aims at demonstrating constructivist learning with a Turtlebot robot. 

## Dependencies

The project uses `ROS` (http://wiki.ros.org/) on `Ubuntu`.
The demos are made in the simulated environment `Gazebo` but are designed to work with a real `Turtlebot` (https://www.turtlebot.com/).
