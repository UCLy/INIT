# README of the Incremental Natural Interactions on Turtlebot (INIT) project #

This project is centered around the creation and research of incremental natural interactions on a Turtlebot3 Burger robot

## Dependencies

This project needs `ROSCORE` to function properly.

A `ROSCORE` compatible Linux environment is strongly recommended

In case you do not have access to a Turtlebot3 Burger robot, a `ROSCORE` compatible simulator with a working Turtlebot model will also be needed
(for example `Gazebo`)

## Starting the project

Make sure to have installed `ROSCORE` and except if you have a working Turtlebot3, a ROS compatible simulator with an imported Turtlebot3 3d model

You can find instructions to install `ROSCORE` here: http://wiki.ros.org/

The `Gazebo` simulator should be included in the basic ROS package, you can use the "gazebo" command to check if it is the case

You can find instructions to import a Turtlebot3 model here: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/

Refer to the wiki for various pointers on how to get started with the interactions of this project and some technical support
